Huawei LiteOS is a lightweight IoT OS developed by Huawei. This system can be widely used in smart homes, wearable devices, Internet of Vehicles \(IOV\), urban public services, manufacturing, and so on.

Huawei LiteOS was released at the Huawei Network Congress in May 2015. Since the release of open-source community, Huawei LiteOS has enabled partners in terms of technologies, ecosystems, solutions, and commercial support in the NB-IoT market to build an open-source IoT ecosystem. Currently, Huawei has aggregated more than 50 MCUs and solution partners to jointly launch a series of open-source development kits and industry solutions, helping industry customers quickly launch IoT products and services. Such customers are involved in multiple industries, such as meter reading, parking, street lamp, environmental protection, bicycle sharing, and logistics. Moreover, Huawei LiteOS provides developers with a one-stop software platform, lowering development requirements and improving development efficiency.

Currently, Huawei LiteOS open-source project supports chip architectures such as ARM64, ARM Cortex-A, ARM Cortex-M0, Cortex-M3, Cortex-M4, and Cortex-M7.
