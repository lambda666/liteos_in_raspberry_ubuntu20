STM32CubeMX is a graphical development tool launched by STMicroelectronics \(ST\). It supports all STM32 series products, allows users to easily configure chip peripheral pins and functions, and generates a bare metal project using the C language in one-click mode.

The bare-metal project provides hardware configuration files and peripheral driver files for porting, and can test the basic functions of the development board. The following describes how to create a bare metal project for the ALIENTEK STM32F407.
