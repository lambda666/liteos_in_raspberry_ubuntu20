For embedded devices, the chip models and peripheral devices differ greatly, and the resources are limited. Therefore, the IoT OS cannot adapt to and integrate all drivers like Windows or Linux. Generally, the IoT OS adapts to some chips or development boards first. To enable the operating system to run on other chips or development boards, porting is required.

Development board porting includes CPU architecture porting, board-level/peripheral driver porting, and operating system porting.
