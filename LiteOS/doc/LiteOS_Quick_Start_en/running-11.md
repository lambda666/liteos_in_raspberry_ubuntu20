Huawei LiteOS Studio uses the burning function to start the QEMU VM and run Huawei LiteOS. For details about how to configure the burner and run Huawei LiteOS, see  [Starting the realview-pbx-a9 Emulation Project](https://liteos.gitee.io/liteos_studio/#/project_stm32?id=realview-pbx-a9%e6%89%a7%e8%a1%8cqemu%e4%bb%bf%e7%9c%9f). After the burning is successful, Huawei LiteOS is automatically started. The following information is displayed on the  **TERMINAL**  screen. Press  **Enter**  to enter the shell CLI window \(the  **Huawei LiteOS \#**  prompt is displayed\).

By default, the shell component of Huawei LiteOS is enabled. You can enter the supported shell command after the  **Huawei LiteOS \#**  prompt on the  **TERMINAL**  screen to run the shell command, as shown in the following figure. If you want to rebuild the system, exit the shell CLI window first.
