QEMU is a generic and open-source virtualization emulator that uses software to emulate hardware devices. When QEMU directly emulates a CPU, it can run an operating system independently. For details about QEMU, see  [https://github.com/qemu/qemu](https://github.com/qemu/qemu). The realview-pbx-a9 project uses QEMU to emulate the Cortex-A9 processor to run Huawei LiteOS.
